# Profile tools

## 2.0.0

9 July 2025

Since FieldTwin 8.1 the API returns connection profiles using a newer dynamic sampling method
that generates points with variable spacing (unlike the older "legacy" sampling that used a
fixed spacing) and more accurately tracks the terrain. This makes it suitable for use with
both designed and imported connections.

* Changed the options for `options.profileType`:
  * `default` now exports a sampled XYZ profile for all connection types
    * The XY values follow the path of the control points for designed connections,
      or the imported XY points for imported connections
    * The Z values continue to be determined by the connection's
      "connection follows bathymetry" attribute
  * `sampled` is now equivalent to `default`
  * `raw` is unchanged
  * `keepSurvey` is a new value that attempts to determine if an imported connection
    contains survey data. This is determined by "connection follows bathymetry" being
    `false` and the number of imported points being greater than `minimumSurveyPoints`.
    When survey data is detected it is exported as `raw`, else `default`.
* Added a new option for `minimumSurveyPoints` that specifies the minimum number of
  points before a data set can be considered as exportable

Users of v1 should find that v2 is a drop-in replacement, but since the default profile
data for imported connections is now sampled this is considered to be an incompatibility.

  matching when metaDatumId is different coming from an external subProject

## 1.3.0

## 1.1.1

16 October 2024
